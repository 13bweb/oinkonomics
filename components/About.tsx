        <p className="text-gray-800 leading-relaxed">
          Oinkonomics is more than just an NFT collection; it's a social and artistic experience. 
          The project aims to create a playful mirror of Solana's financial ecosystem, where wallet 
          value doesn't determine paid access, but rather a unique visual identity. There's no sale, 
          no treasury to fill. Minting is free (users only pay Solana network fees) because the goal 
          isn't commercial. It's about celebrating participation in the ecosystem, transforming raw 
          data into "oinks and insights", and building a community around a fun and original idea.
