# Server wallet keypair path (absolute path to the server's keypair file)
# This wallet will be used to sign allowlist transactions
SERVER_KEYPAIR_PATH=/path/to/your/server-keypair.json

# Candy Machine IDs (get these after deploying with Sugar)
# Replace with actual Candy Machine IDs from mainnet deployment

RICH_CM_ID=your-rich-candy-machine-id-here

# Security Notes:
# 1. SERVER_KEYPAIR_PATH should be an absolute path to a keypair file on your server
# 2. The server keypair must be funded with SOL to pay for allowlist transactions
# 3. Never commit the actual .env.local file to version control
# 4. Use a paid RPC service for production to avoid rate limiting
# 5. Test all configurations on devnet before deploying to mainnet
